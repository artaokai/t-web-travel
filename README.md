2. Extract it to your Jellyfin plugins directory:

   /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/AniWorldDownloader/
   ```
   The folder should contain `Jellyfin.Plugin.AniWorld.dll` and `meta.json`.

## Requirements

- Jellyfin 10.11.x
- .NET 9.0 (for building from source)
- ffmpeg (bundled with Jellyfin)

## How It Works

1. Searches use aniworld.to's AJAX search endpoint
2. Series, season, and episode pages are scraped to find provider links
3. Provider redirect URLs are resolved to embed pages
4. Each provider has a dedicated extractor that pulls out the direct stream URL
5. ffmpeg downloads the stream and saves it as MKV

Supported extractors:
- **VOE**: Decodes obfuscated JSON (ROT13, base64, char shift) to extract HLS URLs
- **Filemoon**: Handles both modern Byse API (AES-256-GCM) and legacy packed JS
- **Vidmoly**: Extracts HLS URLs from JavaScript sources
- **Vidoza**: Extracts MP4 URLs from source tags
